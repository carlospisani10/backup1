### Instructions

* Use the inspector to explore the database and print out the table names stored within it

* Using the inspector, print out the column names and data types for each of the tables contained within the SQLite file

* Reflect the `emoji` table into a SQLAlchemy class and start a session that can be used to query that table

* Using Matplotlib, create a horizontal bar chart and plot the emoji score in descending order. Use `emoji_id` as the y-axis labels and plot only the top 10 emojis ranked by score

* Create the same kind of chart using Pandas to plot the data instead of Matplotlib
